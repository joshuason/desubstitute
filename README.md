    ☑︎ any edits in cipherkey should apply changes to workarea  
    ☐ any edits in workarea should apply to cipherkey  
☐ editing should disable input field being changed  

☐ options to remove spacing  
☐ options to remove characters  

☐ any changes in input should make appropriate changes to output

To fix:
☐ Keys can be mapped to same values eg ‘a’ and ‘e’ can both map to ‘c’ (a: ‘c’, e: ‘c’)  
☐ Add window.getSelection to textarea onclick  

Ideas:
☐ could have three areas: input, output, workarea; where input and workarea are editable
